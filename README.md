This is a small class project; you probably don't want to fork or otherwise use it.

# MUST USE JAVA 6 (Java 5 will not work on this project).

## New features since last meeting:
* Fixed bug in selecting zoom region
* Location thumbnail now updates with zooming

## Essential missing features:
* multithreading
* arbitrary precision
* HD rendering
* custom color palette

## Possible other features:
* installer or java webstart
* intelligently increase max iterations when zooming

## IDE Suggestion:
* IDEA's IntelliJ now (v10+, free) has github integration making it easy to grab this project
* The source code for this project makes extensive use of IntelliJ's 'TODO' note tagging: 40+ items of varying importance and difficulty
