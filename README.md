This is a small class project; you probably don't want to fork or otherwise use it.

# MUST USE JAVA 6 (Java 5 will not work on this project).

## Essential missing features:
* arbitrary precision

## Possible other features:
* intelligently increase max iterations when zooming

## IDE Suggestion:
* IDEA's IntelliJ now (v10+, free) has github integration making it easy to grab this project
* The source code for this project makes extensive use of IntelliJ's 'TODO' note tagging: ~20 items of varying importance and difficulty
